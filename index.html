            Greeting everyone. Today, I am here to deliver a speech on APJ Abdul Kalam. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam’s full name was Avul
            Pakir Zainuldeben Abdul Kalam, very few people know him by his full name as he was mostly addressed as ‘Missile Man of
            India’ and ‘People’s President’. He was born into a very poor family in Rameswaram on October 15, 1931.

                and enjoyed reading, but his family did not have sufficient income for his school fees, so to support his education, he
                would wake up early in the morning and ride a bicycle 3 kilometres from home to collect newspapers and sell them. </p>
